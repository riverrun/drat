Drat
====

Text (readability) analysis tool written in Python.

Features
~~~~~~~~

Drat is a tool that analyzes reading texts and produces a brief report
which provides the following information:

- the Dale-Chall readability score.
- the Coleman-Liau Readability Index.
- the number of uncommon words (based on the General Service List).
- a list of all of these uncommon words (if you choose the verbose option).


Drat supports **docx**, **odt**, **ods**, **odp** files as well as text
files and urls.

You can also analyze multiple texts / links by creating a text file
with the filenames / links written in it.

A simple example of how drat can be used in a web application is provided in the
